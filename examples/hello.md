# Hello World

Returns a simple greeting.

## Code

```rhai
"hello from rhai"
```

## How It Works

The script evaluates to a string. No output is printed; the returned value is
the greeting.

Expected console output: *(none)*

## Key Points

- Minimal example that returns a value.
- Useful for verifying a basic Rhai setup.
